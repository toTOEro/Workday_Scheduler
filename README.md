# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

The project can be found at the following link: https://totoero.github.io/Workday_Scheduler/



This workday scheduler is developed for the user to be able to plan out individual hours of their day. By entering their plans in each hour row, they are able to save their plans using the icons on the right side. An indicator will pop to to show that it was successfuly saved to local storage. If a user refreshes the page, the text information will still exist within the fields they saved. Each row dynamically updates as hours pass to indicate if the specific hour row is in the past, present, or future.

The code works by utilizing form elements in the HTML to submit data, and process it within Javascript to save the data into the browser's local storage. 

![A user inputs their schedule for the day for 8AM, 10AM, and 4PM. They save the input, mousing over the notification that appears to indicate that the plans have been successfully submitted. Afterwards, the page is refreshed to show the information is still present on the page.](./Develop/assets/work_day_scheduler.gif)
